# hello-world

I'm a front end developer, but right now I'm taking some time off to enjoy the first couple years of my son's life. Being a stay at home mom was rewarding and challenging, but I'm ready to get back to work again. Trying to dive back in and go through tutorials right now with the aim of having no zero days.
